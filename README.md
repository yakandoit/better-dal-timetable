# Better Dal Time Table

If you're a Dalhousie student, then you've probably spent alot of time on the [Dalhousie Acedemic Timetable](https://self-service.dal.ca/BannerExtensibility/customPage/page/dal.stuweb_academicTimetable) between semesters like me. If you're also like me, then you know that it looks pretty outdated and that it needs a refresh.

During my exchange at the National University of Singapore I was really impressed by there timetable [NUS Mods](https://nusmods.com/). Especially how it had descriptions, a built in calendar, and looked visually appealing. After finding out that it was open source and ran by students I was encouraged to build something similar for Dal, starting with the timetable.

I'll keep this README updated during development
